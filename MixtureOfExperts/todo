For the derivatives, we can precompute P(Z) for both partial derivs.

For the beta derivative, do we sum over all of the j's for the j, or
do we sum over i? I think the indices are messed up

I don't think my implementation of the E step is right

Need to think about when an expert doesn't label an instance
